When using macOS with Bluetooth headphones they can stay connected even when the screen is locked or the Mac is sleeping. This results in needlessly draining the headphone battery life.

`hedy` disconnects and reconnects bluetooth device automatically when screen is locked or unlocked. Detecting sleeping is a todo because I wrote this in 5 minutes.
